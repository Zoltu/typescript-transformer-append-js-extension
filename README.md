# **DEPRECATED**
I wrote this in hopes that I could continue writing reasonable looking TypeScript until the TypeScript devs came around to seeing reason and added support for import rewriting.  Unfortunately, it appears they are standing their ground firmly and are unlikely to ever change their position.  Along with that, changes to tsc have caused this plugin to stop working and updating it is a non-trivial task.

For these reasons, I have personally stopped using this project and resorted to just adding an (incorrect) `.js` extension to all of my `.ts` imports.  I won't be updating this project anymore, but it may be worthwhile to look at the forks of this project to see if someone is maintaining a fork.

# Abstract
Teach the TypeScript compiler to emit JavaScript files that can be run natively in the browser using es2015 module syntax.

# Motivation
Browsers now support loading modules natively, without needing to rely on bundlers.  However, unlike in NodeJS, the browser cannot try a bunch of different paths to find a file, it must fetch the correct file in a single standard HTTP request on the first try.  This means that when you do `import { Foo } from './foo'`, the browser will try to fetch a file at the path `http://my-domain/path/foo`.  Unless you configure your HTTP server to serve up JS files when no extension is provided, the web server will likely not find any file at that path because the actual file lives  at `http://my-domain/path/foo.js`.  One potential solution to this problem is to write your TS like `import { Foo } from './foo.js'`.  TypeScript is clever enough that it will realize that you _really_ meant `foo.ts` during compilation, and it will successfully find type information.  However, ts-node is [not clever enough](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/783) to handle these faux paths so if you want a library that works in either ts-node or browser you are out of luck.

The hope is that eventually TypeScript will [add support for appending the `.js` extension as a compiler option](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/16577), but for the time being we'll have to do it ourself.

## Note
If your project includes files with `.` in the filename (e.g., `my.modules.tests.ts`), you probably want to use https://github.com/nvandamme/typescript-transformer-append-js-extension instead, which has a bit more complex logic for deciding when to append the extension and when not to.  Instructions/usage are the same, just change `@zoltu/typescript-transformer-append-js-extension` to `@nvandamme/typescript-transformer-append-js-extension` in the two places below.

# Usage
1. Install `typescript`, `ttypescript`, and this transformer into your project if you don't already have them.
	```
	npm install --save-dev typescript
	npm install --save-dev ttypescript
	npm install --save-dev @zoltu/typescript-transformer-append-js-extension
	```
1. Add the transformer to your es2015 module `tsconfig-es.json` (or whatever `tsconfig.json` you are using to build es2015 modules)
	```json
	// tsconfig-es.json
	{
		"compilerOptions": {
			"module": "es2015",
			"plugins": [
				{
					"transform": "@zoltu/typescript-transformer-append-js-extension/output/index.js",
					"after": true,
				}
			]
		},
	}
	```
1. Write some typescript with normal imports
	```typescript
	// foo.ts
	export function foo() { console.log('foo') }
	```
	```typescript
	// index.ts
	import { foo } from './foo'
	foo()
	```
1. Compile using `ttsc`
	```
	npx ttsc --project tsconfig-es.json
	```

## Alternative Solutions

The recommendation from the TypeScript team is to have all of your TS imports be of the form `import ... from './whatever.js'`.  I think this is bad because `whatever.js` is what is being imported at runtime, but it doesn't exist at compile time (the compiler generates it) and it requires specialized editor tooling to navigate to the referenced file plus requires the developer to understand the intricacies of the compiler.  This would be similar to C requiring that you import `foo.o` instead of `foo.h` (or something akin to that).

However, if you have an existing project that has no extensions and you want to follow Microsoft's recommendation then you can use a tool like https://github.com/milahu/random/blob/master/javascript/typescript-autofix-js-import-extension.js to do a one-time update of everything in your project in a way that ensures you only hit the imports that TypeScript cares about.
